# Upcoming-Movies
- I developed this app with java and eclipse with ADT plugin.  - This app provides the upcoming movies with image slider.  - I used a movie database API (themoviedb.org) to get the upcoming movies with photos. - Here's the main link with my API key which it results a JSON data for the upcoming movies:  http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=b7cd3340a794e5a2f35e3abb820b497f  - I parsed it with volley library(is a library to make networking calls)  - The app needs internet connection. - The maximum of photos per movie is 5. - UX :the app is easy and fast and provides all the info that you need about the movie. - The code is clean and concise with advanced java design pattern and it respects java naming conventions. - Everything works fine (no code errors, no ANR, no crashes, no defects) - If you want more explanation with more details please inform me.
